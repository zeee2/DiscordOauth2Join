Protect discord server invite links!

## Setup
I will not help setting up the discord application, but just python.

First, install the requirements.
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once that's finished, you can go ahead and make a config file, by doing:
```
$ python3 main.py
$ nano config.json
```
Then you can go ahead and change the needed stuff in there. _MARKED WITH "CHANGE THIS"_

And the last thing you have to do, is running the server.
```
$ python3 main.py
```
If there's any issues during setup, feel free to post an issue.
